# ODHK CKAN : The Open Data Portal for Hong Kong

## Distribution of Tasks

Our ToDo list is managed through (GitHub Issues)[https://github.com/ODHK/ckan/issues]. Please sign up for GitHub and feel free to assign yourself to any issues which haven't been picked up yet. To give you a sense of the road map, issues are also organised by milestones, which are one week's worth of activity.

**Please provide me with your Github Usernames so I can add you ad collaborators**

## Google Docs

Non-technical files are shared through [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0By1PpmUMozGfTXZvalAybXp3Ulk&usp=sharing)

## Technical

Development is expected to be done on [feature-branches](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0By1PpmUMozGfTXZvalAybXp3Ulk&usp=sharing), and sent in for review as a pull-request. `master` is considered to be reflective of what is running in production. So whenever you merge in non-trivial code-changed, please also deploy to the server.

The server setup will be detailed later, but will be on Ubuntu 12.04 in production.

## Installation

See the [CKAN Documentation](http://docs.ckan.org) for installation instructions.
